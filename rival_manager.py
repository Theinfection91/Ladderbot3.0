    Class to hold methods for keeping up
    and processing data for the Rival mechanic
    that I am working on. At first this will
    help to label teams as rivals after so many challenges
    between each other in a divisonal ladder. 

    Eventually I'd like to also be able to have a player
    rival mechanic as well by keeping track of how many times
    players have faced each other.
